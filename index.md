## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
Our section is doing everything a bit differently, so we started off immediately brainstorming the product we want to deliver to benefit the education sector. I really enjoyed learning about the full product development cycle, from the start where our group had so many different ideas on what to develop to everyone working on the same project but taking different parts. It's also a new experience to think from a lecturer's perspective and think about how we can teach people without any programming experience.

## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

For next quarter I’d like to investigate how to auto apply AI assisted question generation and see how it can improve student engagement and retention in beginner programming courses. As of now we asked AI to come up with questions that we will compile and test to put on our DataLingo app, we got those info from DSC10 course website and some past exams, and some of the basic materials of data science. But for next quarter we want to be able to put the app on mobile as a mobile app instead of a browser app and have AI generate smart questions based on how well the student performs.

## 3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

Our focus this quarter is mostly on backend AI and data structures/storage, so we are trying to get the browser app functional, not necessarly user friendly in terms of UI and design. For next quarter I’d like to shift toward frontend with more user facing features, gathering feedback directly from learners (recruited from local highschool hopefully) to guide model refinement rather than relying solely on technical metrics.

## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I want to learn how to embed AI into our user interfaces and maybe some UI/UX knowledge. I know most groups are doing research based things, which we already did that for a lot of other classes. But our project delivers a product so I wish we can learn more about design and how to use code for frontend things.
